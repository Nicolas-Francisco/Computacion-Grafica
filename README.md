This project's goal is to collect the 3 main Works of the _Computer Graphics_ course, which is obligatory to obtain the _Computer Science Engineering_ degree in the University of Chile. These 3 main works have different levels of difficulty going from easiest to hardest, and all work with Open GL using python. 

_Tarea 1b - Space Wars_
---
The goal of this work is to create a basic 2D game called _Space Wars_ similar to [_Space Invaders_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) using textures, basic shapes, keyboard comands and transformations using Open GL. This work was graded with a 86/100, where the main problems where with the resume and presentation of the game instead of the game itself.

_Tarea 2b - Crazy Racer_
---
The goal of this work is to create a basic 3D game called _Crazy Racer_ similar to [_Mario Kart_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart) using curves in 3d, textures, basic shapes, keyboard comands and transformations using Open GL. This work was graded with a 96/100, where the main problems where with the resume and presentation of the game instead of the game itself.

_Tarea 3a - EDP's_
---
The goal of this work is to create a solution to a problem given using Partial Derivatives Equations in Open GL. This work was graded with a 60/100, where the main problems where with border cases in PDEs.
