My personal repository for _Modeling and Computer Graphics_ course assignments, 5th semester, Computer Science Engineering. This project's goal is to collect the 3 main Works of the _Computer Graphics_ course, which is obligatory to obtain the _Computer Science Engineering_ degree in the University of Chile. These 3 main works have different levels of difficulty going from easiest to hardest, and all work with Open GL using python and jupyter notebook.

_Assignment 1b - Space Wars_
---
A basic 2D game called _Space Wars_ similar to [_Space Invaders_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) using textures, basic shapes, keyboard comands and transformations using Open GL. To run the proyect is necessary to run the file _space-war.py_.
This work was graded with a 86/100.

_Assignment 2b - Crazy Racer_
---
A basic 3D game called _Crazy Racer_ similar to [_Mario Kart_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Kart) using curves in 3d, textures, basic shapes, keyboard comands and transformations using Open GL. To run the proyect is necessary to run the file _crazy-racer-final.py_.
This work was graded with a 96/100.

_Assignment 3a - The Aquarium problem with EDP's_
---
The goal of this work is to create a solution to the "Aquarium problem" using Partial Derivatives Equations modeling with Open GL.
